# winutils
Windows binaries for the Hadoop version

The winutils in [cdarlint/winutils](https://github.com/cdarlint/winutils) are not available on my Windows 11 environment with a compatibility error message. I have rebuilt winutils for the x64 environment.These are built directly from the same git commits that were used to create the official ASF release.
