# winutils
Windows binaries for the Hadoop version

These are built directly from the same git commits that were used to create the official ASF release.
The winutils binary of [cdarlint/winutils](https://github.com/cdarlint/winutils)  is not compatible with my Windows 11 environment. I have rebuilt winutils for the  Windows11 x64.
